									<h2>How Much Did I Spend Again? - Financial Expenditure Management with Python </h2>
									<p>This project is an exploratory analysis of Amazon spending trends using Excel and Python Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Since I completed frequent Amazon purchases during university, this analysis provides insights into spending habits, categories, and changes over the years. 
									I extracted order data, cleaned and transformed it, then visualized spending trends with the goal of identifying patterns and making data-driven recommendations to optimize future purchasing decisions.
